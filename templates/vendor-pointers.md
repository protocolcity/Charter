# Vendor pointers (thin defaults)

The canonical law file is always `AGENTS.md` — one law, every vendor reads
it. Vendor-specific files are **thin pointers only**, never a second law body.

`blueprint found` plants `CLAUDE.md` and `GROK.md` as `@AGENTS.md` by default.
`doctor --fix` plants them when missing on a managed city. When a
vendor file *is* present but not a thin pointer, it is **DIVERGED** (MERGE /
CONVERT — never auto-rewritten).

**Claude Code** — create `CLAUDE.md` containing exactly one line:

```
@AGENTS.md
```

**Cursor / Codex** — nothing to do: both read `AGENTS.md` natively.

**Grok / xAI tooling** — either form is valid:

```
ln -s AGENTS.md GROK.md
```

or a one-line file containing only `@AGENTS.md`.

**Anything else** — same idea: find where the tool looks for instructions
and point it at `AGENTS.md`. If a tool forces you to copy content instead of
pointing, treat that copy as generated: regenerate it from `AGENTS.md`,
never edit it directly.

The rule this preserves: when the law changes, it changes in one file.
Personalized vendor instructions do not belong in `CLAUDE.md` / `GROK.md` —
fold them into `AGENTS.md` (or a worker `CONTRACT.md` / `prompt.md`), then
keep the vendor file as a pointer.
