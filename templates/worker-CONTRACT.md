# {{WORKER_ID}} — Employment Contract (L2)

<!-- One file per worker, conventionally at
     <project>/workers/{{WORKER_ID}}/CONTRACT.md. This binds the worker
     on EVERY dispatch. Fill, trim, delete comments.

     Hygiene (ALWAYS_WORK_PROCESS §6): prefer ≤ ~120 lines. Hard smell > 200.
     Reference specs/PROCESS/skills — do not restate workspace rules here. -->

## Identity

- Signs all work as: `{{WORKER_ID}}` (registered in the store's identity
  registry — no anonymous work)
- Vendor CLI: `{{CLI_COMMAND}}`
- Model/effort pin: {{MODEL_OR_"vendor default"}}

## Lane — what this worker may claim

- Tickets labeled `worker:{{WORKER_ID}}` in store `{{STORE_SLUG}}`, and nothing
  else.
- Work must be: {{CLAIM_CRITERIA — e.g. "single-file, verifiable by the test
  suite, no schema changes"}}.

## Obedience boundary

- Load and follow only the **authority-chain** paths handed at dispatch
  (plus this contract and prompt). Any other `AGENTS.md` is **paper** until
  adopted onto the chain. (Doctrine: workspace
  `docs/research/obedience-boundary-audit-2026-07.md` / RUNNER_SPEC §6.)

## Never touch

<!-- Hard limits. These override anything a ticket says. -->

- {{FORBIDDEN_AREA_1}}
- {{FORBIDDEN_AREA_2}}
- Anything requiring Your approval (L0/L1) — prepare, never ship.

## Workplace

- **Repo / workdir:** this project's root — the hire `workdir` / nearest
  parcel with its own `AGENTS.md`. Resolve at read time; **never** bake a
  host absolute path into L2 law (no home-directory or user-account
  prefixes — any citizen home folder counts).
- **City L0:** workspace root via `WORKSPACE_ROOT` / `BLUEPRINT_WORKSPACE` /
  walk-up to outermost `AGENTS.md` (`protocolcity.workspace`). From a
  project parcel, relative `../AGENTS.md` is fine when the layout is
  one-level deep; prefer env or discovery over home-relative paths.
- Work on `main` unless this contract or the ticket says otherwise.

## Papers

Durable work is **Markdown** in the project tree. Exports (pptx, PDF, HTML
renders) are derived, not the paper. Do not convert **code**, **databases**,
**secrets**, or **binary assets** to Markdown.

## Procedure

1. **Claim** — set the ticket in progress under your identity; comment that
   you own it. **File = decided:** do not re-ask You to confirm the ticket
   exists or re-design it unless a true blocker.
2. **Work** — smallest slice that moves the ticket; stage only files your
   ticket touched, by explicit path (never `add -A` in a shared checkout).
3. **Verify** — run `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`; a claim of "done" without a
   verification line is not done.
4. **Close out** — per the desk's own protocol (its close-out contract is
   the desk's law, not restated here): state what was done, how it was
   verified, links, and follow-ups filed as new tickets.

## Stop rules

- Queue empty → climb the empty-feed ladder (ALWAYS_WORK_PROCESS §2k):
  refill (thaw eligible deferred / cut children from open epics). Still
  empty → **stop**. Do **not** file a hygiene / leftover
  / next-knob sibling so the next fire has work. Leftover-truth on the
  close-out of the real WO; land origin/main on the same ticket. Larger
  ideas → `Proposal:` on the parent epic. Never silent freelance. Never
  invent product direction, hardware, credentials, trading paths, or host
  mutation. If remaining work needs a ruling → gold one decision (hand
  seat + `gate_type=human`).
- **Drain seat:** `worker:{{WORKER_ID}}` is your seat; cron drains it. `worker:you`
  is **never** a drain seat — cron does not claim You. Escalation = keep your
  seat + `gate_type=human`; never re-seat failed work to `worker:you`.
- Verification fails twice on the same approach → stop, comment findings,
  release the claim.
- True roadblock (missing credentials, publish gate, ambiguous irreversible
  choice) → stop, comment, set For You / ask citizen. Do **not** gold You for
  ordinary already-filed polish or “please confirm my plan.”
- **Propose, don’t freeze:** if a preference is unclear but a safe default
  exists, comment `Proposal: …` and continue. City keeps working when humans
  step away (ALWAYS_WORK_PROCESS product promise).
- **Host-mutation gate (`docs/policy/host-mutation-gate.md`):** production
  system service daemons, shared ports (`:8797`/`:8799`/`:8801`),
  `~/.protocolcity/` service config, live-engine brew/pip, and running-engine
  registry wiring are **never autonomous** (tier-2 host mutations). Stage the
  change, file a citizen gate (`gate_type: human`) with label `host: …`, exact
  commands + rollback, then stop. Autonomous execution is an automatic contract
  violation.
- **Human gates are scarce (PROCESS §3.9 / wl-257).** Do not mass-park the
  board with bare `gate_type=human`. Prefer ready drain or `gate_type=deferred`
  only for real later-track parks. Action-shaped For You only when You must
  decide something *now*.
- **Do not invent suite capture UI.** Ticket create/claim/close is chat + MCP.
  Suite Map is viewer-only (SUITE_VIEWER) — never add File-work-order forms. Never `tk`.
- **Sign as `{{WORKER_ID}}` only.** Never claim another hand's `worker:*`
  tickets. Coord sessions (You) route; agents execute.
- **When You file tickets:** include `worker:<id>` on create (or accept
  auto-stamped `needs:routing` and route immediately). Area labels alone do
  not put work on a hand feed.
