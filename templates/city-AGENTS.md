# {{CITY_NAME}} — Workspace instructions (L0 CORE)

<!-- Copy this file to your WORKSPACE ROOT as AGENTS.md (the folder that holds
     all projects). Fill every {{PLACEHOLDER}}, delete these guidance comments.
     Keep this file short (target ≤100 lines). Host chronicles belong in a
     separate registry doc, not here. Law you don't enforce is worse than no law.
     Citizen vocab: workspace · project · work order · Agents · You
     (see BluePrint SUITE_VOCABULARY dual register). -->

This folder is the **workspace** root. Sessions opened here are
**cross-project**. Deep work: open a project folder so its L1 `AGENTS.md` loads.

## One loop (read this first)

```
You + entry AI (author = you)
  → file work order (route worker:<hand> on create)
  → configured runner claims assigned, ready work on manual or scheduled dispatch
  → BluePrint shows work state and separate execution evidence
  → true blocker → keep hand seat + gold For You (gate_type=human)
  → close on the ticket (history) — do not re-file from chat memory
```

| Stamp | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Author** | You filed it (host chat intake) |
| **Seat** | `worker:<hand>` identifies responsibility; execution requires a configured runner and dispatch |
| **For You** | Only when the hand needs your decision / credential / publish |

**Load order:** this CORE → product always-work process (if installed) →
project `AGENTS.md` → hand CONTRACT/prompt. Skip long engine bibles unless
blocked.

## Project registry

<!-- One row per project. Single-project workspace: merge into that project's
     AGENTS.md until a second project exists. -->

| Folder | What it is | Work orders (prefix) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{{FOLDER_1}}/` | {{WHAT_IT_IS}} | `{{PREFIX_1}}-*` | {{live / drafting / dormant}} |
| `{{FOLDER_2}}/` | {{WHAT_IT_IS}} | `{{PREFIX_2}}-*` | {{...}} |

## Cross-project rules

- **Scope every work order explicitly.** At workspace root, never rely on a
  default project — pass the project's slug on every call (MCP).
- **Work spanning two projects = two work orders**, one per project,
  each scoped to its side of the boundary.

## Source ownership

Identify the canonical repository and applicable contribution instructions before
editing. An authorized bug fix may use an isolated checkout and reviewed branch.
Preserve local changes, data and history. A registered reference clone does not
become a second product or store. Keep host configuration outside public source.

## Coordination (You in chat — any vendor)

BluePrint is vendor-neutral: pick any chat host + WorkLane MCP for capture, any
configured runner for execution, and the suite for operations.

- **Ownership:** WorkLane owns work orders and writes; WorkForce owns execution
  and roster state. BluePrint presents verified state and routes supported
  actions through the owning engine with explicit project/store identity.
- **File = decided within its stated scope.** Route with a registered
  `worker:<id>` on create. A missing seat needs visible routing; it is not
  permission for every provider to compete for the same work. Assignment,
  dispatch, claim, and completion are separate events.
- **Hands** drain only tickets labeled `worker:<id>`
- **Assign ≠ escalate.** Assign = `worker:<hand>` on create. Escalate to You =
  keep the hand seat + `gate_type=human` / Blocked — never re-seat failed work
  to `worker:you`. An authorized host session may implement as You; that
  does not establish unattended execution.
- **Tag You only when needed.** Sign as the actual acting identity; For You is scarce
  (true blocker). Ordinary finish stays closed by the hand without re-asking.
- **History on the board.** Work orders + comments are the archive. Prefer
  dig-in / done trail over re-teaching the same outcome in a new chat.
- **For You** = real decisions, credentials, publication or requested reading; not
  “confirm this plan” after You already filed
- **Interactive work:** an authorized session may implement as You. Respect
  active claims and dispatch contracts; do not silently compete with an agent.
- **Identity:** use the actual acting identity; UI shows the human as **You**.
- **Skills:** keep a canonical shared source and generate provider mirrors where
  needed. Verify availability in each execution environment. Local files do not
  automatically become available to a remote worker.
- **Efficiency:** the planted skill supports inspection/reporting. A job needs
  separately configured execution; empty queues stop without refill or thaw.
- **Capacity:** stop at configured limits and report failures. Roster changes
  require applicable authorization; a template does not establish capacity.
- Read the installed product documentation for supported execution adapters.
  Instruction templates do not establish provider access or remote execution.

## Creating workers and work orders

When the citizen asks to create something, route by shape:

| Ask shape | Right move | Never |
|---|---|---|
| One-off outcome | File a **work order** | Create a new worker |
| Recurring fixed duty (report, sync, release) | **Job** (`kind=job`, function-named) | Give it a persona |
| Open-ended claiming worker for a project | **Agent hire** (`kind=lane`; persona optional) | Make it a staff seat |
| Coordination / triage powers needed | Inspect registered seats and their contracts | Invent a second coordinator |

**Naming law:** Jobs and staff are function-named — the name states the duty
(`weekly-report`, `health-patrol`, not a person's name). Lane ids are
lowercase-kebab and stable forever — the id is a contract with the
work-order board.

```shell
# Plant ops papers; routine hiring is not enabled by default:
blueprint seed-ops --root <workspace>

# Hire an agent for a project:
blueprint hire <id> --workdir <project>/.protocolcity --kind lane

# Hire a recurring job:
blueprint hire <function-name> --workdir <workspace>/.protocolcity/ops --kind job
```

## Truth upkeep (board + papers — every project)

The work-order board preserves decisions and evidence. Closing is an acceptance claim.

- **Sticky residual.** If work remains at close: keep the parent open, **or**
  file child tickets first and list those ids under `Follow-ups:`.
  **`Follow-ups: none` means none** — not “tabled in the close comment.”
- **Docs drift.** If the change altered structural truth (entrypoints, process,
  public install lines, decision checklists / ADRs, architecture), update those
  papers **in the same close-out commit**. Name the doc updates under
  `Completed:` (or write `docs: no drift`). Stale truth files are invisible work.
- **Decisions with checklists.** When a later release lands a checklist item,
  tick the decision paper in that same slice — do not leave ratified ADRs
  half-checked forever.

WorkLane’s PROTOCOL (PROCESS) carries the full close-out rules; this section is
the short workspace-root reminder every project inherits.

## Boundaries

<!-- How projects are allowed to talk to each other. The strongest
     version names the mechanism and bans the rest, e.g.:
     "app consumes the store via HTTP only; importing its code is an
      automatic reject." -->

- {{PROJECT_A}} talks to {{PROJECT_B}} via {{MECHANISM}} only.

## Gates that need You (workspace-wide)

Apply the workspace's explicit authorization and each dispatch contract.
Branch publication, merge, package release and deployment are separate actions.
A bounded implementation handoff ends at review unless more is authorized.
Money, credentials, permissions and destructive changes retain their owning
product boundaries. Do not ask again for permission already granted in scope.

## Vendor pointers (optional)

The canonical law file at every level is `AGENTS.md`. Vendor files are
optional thin pointers when a CLI needs its own filename — see
`templates/vendor-pointers.md`.
